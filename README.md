## Using Image Processing and Transferring Learning to Classify Dog Breeds
The idea for this project is to classify different dog breeds through machine learning. A lot of dog breeds can look somewhat similar, especially to the human eye, so can a convolutional neural network do better at identifying various types of dogs?

Given an image, the Dog Classifier can:
- Identify the type of dog breed
- Tell the dog they are a good dog

Data Sources:

http://vision.stanford.edu/aditya86/ImageNetDogs/main.html

Background Information:

The data comes from Stanford (also known as Stanford Dogs Dataset)


Results:


Conclusion:


Future Direction
More dog breeds?!
Similar ones, like Siberian Husky and Alaskan Malamute. Will the model be able to detect the difference (or is there a noticeable difference)
Detect dog age
If there is more than one dog in the picture, identify each dog in the picture
